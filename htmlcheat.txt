absolute URLs direct abolutely i.e. www.google.com
relative URLs direct from the pathway your index is located
    to go to the root of your folder relatively...
        <a href="/">Home</a>
        from root, if other files exist they can be linked using only the file name (i.e. <a href="about.html">About</a>)
        from root, if other folders containing files exist they can be linked with folder/filename (i.e. <a href="about/about.html">About</a>)
        from subfolder, to back up a folder use ../ (i.e. folder 3 is in folder 2 is in folder 1, want to reference FAQ in folder 1 from folder 3 = <a href="../../FAQ.html">FAQ</a>)
    Use relative URLs whenever possible
Can use link to email <a href="mailto:mjezegou@meridian.mfg.com">Contact Me</a>
An anchor is a link to a certain spot on the same page, like the "Go to top" function
    <a name = "top"></a> (at top)
    <a href ="#top">Go To Top</a> (at bottom)
    <a href = "index.html#top">Go Home</a> (back to index then top)

id's are unique where class are not
<div class="xxx"> or <div id="xxx">

Link images using <img src = "LINK" /> where LINK format = format for creating a href (both absolute and relative)
<img src = "LINK" height = "PXLS" width = "PXLS (or auto)" alt = "desc if pic breaks" title = "hoverover popup text" />
<figure>
    <img src = "link" alt = "broke" title = "hover text" />
