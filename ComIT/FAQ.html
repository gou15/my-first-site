                            How did Kaizo get started?
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            A long long time ago (2007), a Japanese fellow by the name of Takemoto built a Mario game for his roommate called Kaizo Mario World. This game ended up appearing on YouTube under the name <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r86NLwCYXfk" target = "_blank">Asshole Mario</a>.
                            As the video gained more and more views, eventually the ROM was uploaded online and shared. At a big speedrunning event, <a href = "https://gamesdonequick.com/" target = "_blank">AGDQ 2015</a>, a runner by the screenname Dram55 
                            played the Kaizo game in front of a massive crowd. Kaizo Mario World was not the first hack, nor the first hard hack, but it was the first one to gain traction and noteriety as a polished and playable hack. 
                            Kaizo type games continued to make their way into the mainstream with the release of Mario Maker 
                            <a href = "https://kotaku.com/mario-maker-players-are-in-an-arms-race-to-make-the-har-1739431432" target = "_blank">and(1) </a> 
                            <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PangaeaPanga" target = "_blank">PangeaPanga's(2) </a>
                            <a href = "https://kotaku.com/the-creator-of-the-hardest-super-mario-world-level-ever-1732411516" target = "_blank">level(3) </a>
                            <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sxY8pELhqM" target = "_blank">P-break(4). </a>
                            P-Break was released, the fandom went crazy, Kaizo levels in Mario Maker hit the mainstream, and a subset of that mainstream fanbase turned to SMW Kaizo hacks for a different type of challenge. 
                            You can play P-Break yourself if you have access to a copy of Super Mario Maker for WiiU. Enter level code 6059-0000-005E-4FB5. Good luck!

                            Is any of this legal?
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            The short answer is yes. The longer answer is "check your local laws." In Canada and the United States, everything 
                            contained on and linked to from this site is legal. Emulators are legal. The tools used to header and patch ROMs are legal. Having a digital copy of a ROM 
                            from a game that you physically and legally own (i.e. you've purchased the game and it is still in your possession) is legal. If you came here to download
                            ROMs or to get directed to where you can download ROMs then this site won't help you. This site will show you how to download the patches that you can apply to your own legally 
                            obtained ROM file. It is not legal to share ROMs with people who do not legally own a copy of the game, nor is it legal to sell your ROM hacks as they make use of trademarked 
                            assets. Kapiche? Don't share ROM files and you'll be fine.

                        <dt>
                            Why not just use Mario Maker?
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            Lots of Kaizo SMW players also play Kaizo levels in Mario Maker (available on the WiiU, 3DS, and Nintendo Switch). There are 2 big reasons to play Kaizo 
                            SMW instead of Mario Maker:
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Game physics - playing on the Super Mario World setting in Mario Maker and actually playing Super Mario World are very different. They feel different, 
                                    the way Mario acts and controls is different, and the way Mario interacts with objects and other sprites is different.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Limitations - the limitations of Mario Maker are set by Nintendo. They'll dictate what enemies, items, backdrops, tilesets, etc... will be in the game 
                                    and how those things behave. Because Kaizo ROM hacks are built by the community in a builder built by the community, and because that builder allows 
                                    the input of custom code outside of the normal limitations of the original Super Mario World, the options and possibilities for level creation are 
                                    limitless. Want Mario to look like Bob Ross and play in a world where the backgrounds are all Bob Ross paintings? <a href = "https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=18200" target = "_blank">There's a hack for that.</a>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </dd><br />
                        <dt>
                            I'm watching someone play a Kaizo game and they keep saying "X." What does "X" mean?
                        </dt>

                            Why is it so hard? Do people really enjoy this?
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            Honestly, not a lot of people get enjoyment out of playing Kaizo Mario... I recommend trying it, but it probably isn't for you. But the people who like 
                            Kaizo really really like Kaizo. And lots of them post videos of them playing various Kaizo hacks. And most people in the Kaizo communities are the people 
                            who just enjoy watching and talking about Kaizo Mario. You don't have to be a football player to love the NFL, just like you don't need to play Kaizo to 
                            love watching Kaizo Mario.
                        </dd><br />
                        <dt>
                            Are there SMW ROM hacks that are not Kaizo hacks? Are there hacks for other video games?
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            Yes and yes. This site is only for Kaizo Super Mario World hacks. You can find information about other hacks and other games in the <a href ="resources.html" target="_self">Other Resources</a> section.

                            Why do these games have weird names? What's a "Super Dram World?"
                        </dt>
                        <dd>
                            Most games are named after a community figure. Grand Poo World is named after Grand Poo Bear who is a very active member of the Mario community. Super Dram World is named 
                            after Dram55 who helped pave the way for what Kaizo has become today.

                                Stands for "tool-assisted speedrun." This is a speedrun that is created with the help of 3rd party tool to achieve absolutely perfect 
                                gameplay. These look ridiculous and are pretty impressive feats. These are played back by a computer and are not humanly possible. If something 
                                is considered "TAS only" it means that it's achievable but the inputs to achieve the desired result are too difficult for a human.

                                it would suggest that you need to make an input on an exact frame to achieve a desired result (like a wall clip).

                                These are various grades of "hard" for Kaizo. Light games are achievable by a human player. These are the only Kaizo hacks that are played by humans. 
                                Hard games are extremely difficult but technically achievable by a human with the help of emulator tools like savestates or frame advance. Pit 
                                Levels are not achievable by a human being; these are TAS-only hacks and are entertaining to watch but impossible to play. Check out <a href = "https://youtu.be/JuZMvMtZCWU?t=24" target = "_blank">Item Abuse</a>.

                                but have a mechanism to prevent the player from spawning the item early.

                                    In SMW, Mario falls slower while the jump button is held. This makes it possible for Mario to travel further in the air by holding the jump button. If you need to let go of jump 
                                    while in the air (maybe because there are spikes above you and you can't jump to full height) but you still need "slow fall" down, you can achieve this by "regrabbing" the jump 
                                    button while you're in the air.

                                    If Mario doesn't outright kill an enemy (like throwing a Koopa into a pit instead of jumping on it) the enemy will respawn if Mario leaves the area and comes back.
