	Game Mechanics
		Don't be overwhelmed - a lot of kaizo players don't know the specifics of these things. It has a lot more to do with feel and timing than knowing the numbers.
		Regrab
		Spin Jump
		Screen Scroll
		Spawn/Respawn
		Flight (P speed, fall speed, dive speed)
		Shell/POW/spring/P jumps, including midairs
		Turnback
		P speed
		Some enemy mechanics (walk off edge or not, Chucks, fishies...)
		(rewatch Juz play Kindergarten for better mechanics)
	OK I want to Start Playing
		Visit How to Play (link) and follow those instructions first
		Launch the emulator
		Open the patched ROM
		Super NT, SNES Classic (death counter doesn't work), SD2SNES
