                    <p>
                        You've never heard of kaizo before, or you've only just started to discover it. Maybe you know a few of the words, or you've seen a <a href = "https://youtu.be/JuZMvMtZCWU?t=24" target = "_blank">YouTube video</a> or two of 
                        extremely difficult Super Mario World levels. Maybe you're a rom hacker from another game altogether. Maybe you're looking to play your own Kaizo Mario, 
                        or you're an aspiring game designer looking to get some practice building your own levels. Or maybe you just Google'd "really really hard video games because I 
                        need a challenge." Either way, you're here because you want to learn more about Kaizo Mario.
