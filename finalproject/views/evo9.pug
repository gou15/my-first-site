  h1 Getting Data Quick and Easy
  br
  p
    | It&apos;s been a ride. We went from knowing nothing and having no tools to being equipped to write code, learning how a browser works and how it interprets a markup language,
    | what that interpretation does to the content we want to present, embedding images, audio, video, and other content into our own pages, get information from a user with
    | forms, add some color and style, utilize other people&apos;s code to organize and control how our content is presented, and then use a coding language to manipulate not only
    | the data we receive but the markup language itself to dynamically alter our page. We even learned how to pull information in JSON format from an API, interpret that data,
    | and again present it in a user-friendly way.
  br
  p
    | What&apos;s very cool about the journey you&apos;ve taken so far is that all the HTML you&apos;ve been reading has been generated by PUG, and all the pages you&apos;ve flipped through
    | (well, the ones that aren&apos;t external) are being served to you through a JavaScript server called Express.
  br
  p
    | Unfortunately that's going to end our journey. We learned more about NPM modules and using databases that will not be demonstrated for 2 reasons... first I'm not super comfortable 
    | with the internet at large being able to upload whatever to my database, and second I'm short on time. For the purposes of our final presentation, this is it. I intend on continuing 
    | with this site's development to demonstrate different NPM modules and expand on Express' functionality. The scope I had planned for this project was bigger than I expected...

    | Thank you for taking this journey, and thank you to ComIT for making it possible for me.
