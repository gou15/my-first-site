    It's day 1. We don't know any code at all. First things first we're going to learn some definitions, get some tools, and talk about development before we start developing anything. 
    The website you're on right now isn't even possible with the knowledge we have yet. There is zero styling and only the most basic HTML used to build this particular page. 
    Hence it's all black and white and it's all in one long line. We don't know any different yet. We downloaded and installed git from https://git-scm.com (sorry, we don't know how 
    to make links yet; you're going to have to copy and paste that). Then we downloaded and installed Visual Studio Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/. We learned that HTML 
    is the content of a website, that CSS is the layout, and JavaScript is your interactive element. We learned that backend development is server based and makes websites work, 
    while frontend development is what the user sees and interacts with. A full stack developer can do both. A network is computers communicating. A router is a computer that 
    makes sure messages get sent to the right destination. Since routers are computers you can have routers talk to routers, so you can scale your networks. A modem turns network 
    information into information manageable by the phone infrastructure and vice versa. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) grant users access to their routers which are networked 
    to other ISPs routers. And finally, the internet is the infrastructure of these networks. A few more definitions we learned were IP address (a unique address identifying a 
    computer), domain name (which is a human-friendly way to point to specific IP addresses, like google.com is the domain name for IP address 173.194.121.32), and packets (which are 
    chunks of data that are sent across the web and allow multiple users access to download data at same time).
    <br /><br />
    It's day 2. We don't know how to make line breaks like above yet, but for the ease of continuing we're going to steal them from our future selves. We don't still don't know 
    any code (I'm very sorry for your eyes, this will get more user-friendly as we go), but we're about to play around with some. We copied and pasted some pre-existing code 
    to build our very first site! And, while we don't know how to make links yet, if you want to check it out, it's right <a href = "../my-first-site/index.html" target = "_blank">
    here.</a> It's not fancy but it works. We uploaded this to our Github account which we created go signing up at https://github.com/join. Then we configured our built-in 
    terminal in Visual Studio Code to talk to our Github account and allow us to upload our first site to the internet. By the end of the day we have the tools we need, the accounts 
    we need, we've got everything configured, and we know enough basic commands to get our code online. It's time to start coding (and it's time for YOU to stop having to read 
    a single long line of black text... almost).

EVOLUTION 1
here we get some tools and learn a little about what things are and how they work - no coding, so this website is not possible yet...
https://git-scm.com - download and install git
https://code.visualstudio.com/ - download and install visual code
definitions:
HTML - content
CSS - layout
JavaScript - interaction
backend - server based development, makes websites work
frontend - website development, user experience
full stack - front and back end
network - computers communicating
router - makes sure messages sent go to right destination
a router is a computer, so routers talking to routers is a thing - now you have big networks
modem - turns network info into info manageable by phone infrastructure and vice versa
internet service providers - allows access to routers which have access to other ISP's routers
internet - the infrastructure of these networks
IP address - a unique address identifying a computer
domain name - a human-friendly way to point so specific addresses (i.e. google.com is domain name pointing to IP address 173.194.121.32)
packets - chunks of data sent across the web, allows multiple users access to download data at same time

EVOLUTION 2
still no coding, but setting up the framework by which we can save, modify, share, and execute our code
learned about visual code studio and it's use
created a very basic website which utilized HTML, CSS, and JS
didn't learn what these things are or how to use them, just copied and pasted
index.html, styles.css, script.js
my-first-site  --  actually create and link to it!
https://github.com/join created a github account - just follow the steps
change terminal shell to bash or git bash which makes talking to github easier
configured terminal to talk to your github account
    git config --global user.name <github userID>
    git config --global user.email <github email>
got our first website online
    git init        initializes a github repository or creates an empty one
    git add .       adds files contents to git index
    git commit -m "my first commit"     commits records changes to a repository
added a github origin and sent our files to our github repository
    git remote add origin bash git remote add origin https://github.com/<user>/nodeyqr.git
    git push origin master
told github to use our master branch for github pages
published our site and we were online for the first time... granted it was with a copy-paste website, but this was cool
further git commands:
git status = show working tree status
git log = shows history of commits
git rm img.jpg = removes file img.jpg from repository
git checkout -- img.jpg = restores previous version of removed file
ls -la = display list of folder files
git remote add origin xxx = configures remote git server on github
    origin is default name for main source
git remote -v = grants fetch/push permissions
fetch = gets changes from server
push = uploads local changes to server
git clone = copies a repository into a new directory
work on projects locally, commit changes to repository, and upload to server to share with the world
