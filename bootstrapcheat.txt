GRID SYSTEM https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/layout/grid/
grid system using containers, rows, and columns built with flexbox
bootstrap automatically makes classes mean something
.container is set in pixel width
.container-fluid gives width 100% across all viewports
.row are wrappers for columns
columns are children of their rows

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <div class="colXXX"> (where XXX are column specs)
                <COLUMN 1 CONTENT>
            </div>
            <div class="colXXX">
                <COLUMN 2 CONTENT>

grid columns without a specified width will lay out as equal width columns
    ie four .col-sm will be automatically set to width: 25%;
column classes indicate # of columns you want to use out of max 12/row
    .col-4 = 3 equal-width columns
horizontal padding is built in between columns to create "gutters" (i.e. "no content" zones), 15px each column by default
can remove the padding from the columns by adding .no-gutters to the row class
bootstrap is built with mobile in mind, so there are @media breakpoints set by default, and column sizes are based around those breakpoints
col-xs (0px min) sm (576px min) md (768px min) lg (992px min) or xl (1200px and up) (5 breakpoints)

can mix and match (i.e. set a breakpoint and a column width), like .col-sm-6 (1 column 6 cells wide for small devices and up)
throwing the style= inside your div lets you write additional rules to bootstrap's built in class rules

a closed div with w-25, w-50, w-75, or w-100 will copy the parent column width as a percentage (substitute w for h and now it's height)
totally ok to set different column sizes in same row
use .col-BRKPT-auto to set variable column size based on viewport

using a combination of breakpoints and straight column widths you can set how things will appear on dif devices all in one class assn't
    .col-6 col-md-4 for example is a 6 width column, but reduces to 4 width if on a medium device (min 768px across)
    .col-md-4 will also cause columns to stack at the md breakpoint (i.e. they'll go horizontal rather than side by side, basically sets a minimum screen size to see columns side by side)
    .col-6 is always a 6 width column regardless of viewport

IMAGES https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/images/
responsive images are applied so image scales with parent element
    .img-fluid
    max-width: 100%;
    height: auto;

.img-thumbnail gives an image a rounded 1px border
    other border-radius utilities exist

can assign float classes and text alignment classes to align images as well
    .rounded float-left as an example will round the borders and cause the image to squeeze right and float
    .mx-auto centers images
    above classes are set inside the <img> element
    assigning parent div to "text-center" will also force image elements to be centered
